People nowadays seem to have lost the ability to process "high-fidelity information." The brain's GPU computing power simply isn't enough to run high-load processes like "independent thinking."

What the vast majority of typical Chinese people need is just a Tag, a compressed residue.

For example: Huawei equals patriotism or an intelligence tax, Xiaomi equals losers, and Apple equals traitors.

Once a Tag is slapped on, the brain gets comfortable and stops spinning. These people are like a broken LLM: input a token, and it only spits out those few fixed characters with the highest probability.

This is the so-called "approximate news." Garbage resulting from increased information entropy.

The only way to avoid having your brain violated by this garbage is to clean up the input source. Don't watch those videos where digital influencers shill for money, and don't listen to people in the comments section earning 3,000 a month teaching you how to spend 8,000.

The other day I passed a store and casually touched the Mate 60 or whatever that new thing is called.

I am extremely nauseated by Huawei's "wolf culture" and their practice of using certain sentiments as marketing tools. It looks disgusting—a thick stench of Chinese-style paternalism and collectivist hysteria.

However.

Setting aside this metaphysical stench and returning to the industrial product itself.

Although I am a victim of the nearly full Apple ecosystem, I have to admit that Huawei is indeed in the first tier in the digital realm, leaving other domestic products leagues behind.

The system animations, although they still have a whiff of Android about them, are indeed in the first tier regarding responsiveness and frame drop control, uh...

At this point, some people will feel a sense of dissonance.

They feel dissonance because they still care about dignity, and they still attempt to use logic to unify this world.

The reality is: a company can be a clown in marketing while being a giant in engineering.

These two are not contradictory at all. Let's try to deconstruct Huawei into two objects: Object A: Huawei as a commercial/political symbol (you may have controversies about this). Object B: Huawei phones as a communication tool (which you feel is top-tier after experiencing).

    Conclusion: These two can coexist without contradiction. You can dislike some of its marketing while appreciating its engineering capabilities.

Just like how I can think Tim Cook is a total moron who sacrifices aesthetics for financial reports (that Dynamic Island is truly a stain on the history of human aesthetics; digging a hole in the screen for FaceID, Jobs' coffin lid must be rattling), while being unable to leave the Mac trackpad and ecosystem continuity.

Offline experience is real; online noise is fake.

Most people's definition of "good and bad" is binary.

But in the eyes of the tech elite, products are only about Trade-offs.

Huawei uses the process disadvantage of its SoC to trade for extreme optimization of system scheduling, and uses price premiums to trade for a so-called brand moat.

Android shits in the root directory, trading chaotic file management for so-called "openness" (although current Android, due to cancerous domestic apps, has long been as laggy as shit).

If you don't want to be led astray, just remember one rule:

Trust your contact. When your real tactile feedback tells you "this phone feels great," that is the absolute truth. It doesn't matter if ten thousand idiots online say it's "electronic garbage" or "far ahead."

Of course, I don't use Huawei.
