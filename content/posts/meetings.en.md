Nothing in the world is more tedious than attending meetings. On a perfectly fine day, a crowd of people is forced to drop their urgent, important, and interesting tasks to gather under one roof. All this, just to listen to three or five people flex their rhetorical muscles, arguing over matters that are discussed without decision, decided without execution, or executed without success. It is truly the ultimate method of collective time-wasting.

If it were merely killing time, that might be forgivable. The real tragedy is how it dampens one's spirits and ruins a perfectly good mood. Though a meeting room is not a battlefield, it possesses a stifling air of solemnity. Upon entering, whether wise or foolish, noble or base, everyone shifts out of their normal character. People don masks and harbor private agendas. Faced with redundant drafts and overly detailed clauses, everyone engages in nitpicking and endless deliberation. They strive for wording that is so rigorous, comprehensive, and watertight that it blocks every possible loophole and opportunity once and for all.
