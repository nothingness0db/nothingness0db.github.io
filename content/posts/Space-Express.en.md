Seeing people hyping up **space delivery** services is genuinely hard to take seriously. Do some Chinese people have a bizarre obsession with the title of "Infrastructure Maniac"? Anyone who thinks this can replace standard courier services like SF Express should seriously retake high school physics, or at least solve a couple of mechanics problems before asking such a ridiculous question.

Just think about it: what kind of functionally **low-IQ product manager** would come up with this requirement? Raising the cost by tens of thousands of times just to shave off an hour or two? Doesn't physics deserve some respect? Do you understand **G-force**? The vibration during launch is so intense that if you shipped a MacBook, the screen would probably shatter into dust. Then you'd have to wrap the package in three layers of aerospace-grade cushioning material. Isn't that the definition of **flogging a dead horse** (Chinese: 脱裤子放屁, literally: pulling down pants to fart)?

And the landing is another huge issue. A rocket can't just stop in front of your house like a Meituan delivery driver. The noise is like a cannon going off right next to your ear. It has to land hundreds of miles away from the city, either in the sea or on a remote Gobi desert, and then be transferred back. This is like completely **re-architecting the entire backend** to optimize a 0.1ms latency, only to find that the bottleneck was entirely on the database I/O. It's pure **self-gratification**—a classic example of **over-engineering**.

To be frank, the current niche for this service is for the super-rich elite in life-or-death situations—transporting a heart, a kidney, or sending urgent wartime supplies. The rest of the so-called "**space e-commerce**" is entirely cheap hype, operating in the same way as the current AI industry. All the "applications" are just chains of `if-else` statements, pretending to be AGI, simply to fleece money from the primary market.

**Starship** is cool and impressive to look at, but let's not mythologize it. It's just a **large-scale transport truck**. Unless they can bring the **failure rate** down to the level of commercial aviation, who would dare to use it? Insurance companies would see the policy and immediately run for the hills overnight.
