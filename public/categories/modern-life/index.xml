      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing in the world is more tedious than attending meetings. On a perfectly fine day, a crowd of people is forced to drop their urgent, important, and interesting tasks to gather under one roof. All this, just to listen to three or five people flex their rhetorical muscles, arguing over matters that are discussed without decision, decided without execution, or executed without success. It is truly the ultimate method of collective time-wasting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
