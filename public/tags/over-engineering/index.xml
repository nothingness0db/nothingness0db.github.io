      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seeing people hyping up &lt;strong&gt;space delivery&lt;/strong&gt; services is genuinely hard to take seriously. Do some Chinese people have a bizarre obsession with the title of &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure Maniac&amp;rdquo;? Anyone who thinks this can replace standard courier services like SF Express should seriously retake high school physics, or at least solve a couple of mechanics problems before asking such a ridiculous question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just think about it: what kind of functionally &lt;strong&gt;low-IQ product manager&lt;/strong&gt; would come up with this requirement? Raising the cost by tens of thousands of times just to shave off an hour or two? Doesn&amp;rsquo;t physics deserve some respect? Do you understand &lt;strong&gt;G-force&lt;/strong&gt;? The vibration during launch is so intense that if you shipped a MacBook, the screen would probably shatter into dust. Then you&amp;rsquo;d have to wrap the package in three layers of aerospace-grade cushioning material. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that the definition of &lt;strong&gt;flogging a dead horse&lt;/strong&gt; (Chinese: 脱裤子放屁, literally: pulling down pants to fart)?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
