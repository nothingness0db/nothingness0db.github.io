In a directed graph, if all paths from the entry point to a node v must pass through node u, then we say node u dominates node v, denoted as u dom v. Intuitively, if you want to reach v, you must first go through u, making u like a “checkpoint” on the way to v. Domination relationships have several properties: Every node dominates itself; If a dominates b and b dominates c, then a also dominates c; If a dominates b and b dominates a, then a and b are the same node.

A dominator tree is a tree structure formed by these immediate domination relationships, where the entry point is the root node, and each node’s parent is its immediate dominator. The classic algorithm for constructing dominator trees is the Lengauer-Tarjan algorithm. Although complex to implement, it is highly efficient. It is based on depth-first search and union-find data structures, determining immediate dominators by calculating “semi-dominators.” ","date":"2024-06-20","objectID":"/en/posts/dominator-tree/:2:0","tags":["Graph Theory","Compiler Design","Program Analysis"],"title":"Understanding Dominator Trees","uri":"/en/posts/dominator-tree/"},{"categories":["Technical Discussion"],"content":"Applications of Dominator Trees What use do dominator trees have in compilers? When we represent programs as control flow graphs, dominator trees help us analyze variable lifetimes, identify loop invariants, and construct static single assignment forms. For example, if node A dominates node B, then variables defined in A are definitely available when the program executes B. Besides compiler optimization, dominator trees are also used for: Detecting unreachable code and identifying control dependencies in program analysis; Finding critical nodes in network analysis; Determining which code blocks’ execution depends on which conditions in control flow analysis.

The dominance frontier refers to the set of nodes that are not dominated by a certain node, but have at least one predecessor dominated by that node.
