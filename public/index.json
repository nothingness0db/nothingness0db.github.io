[{"categories":["Modern Life"],"content":"Nothing in the world is more tedious than attending meetings. On a perfectly fine day, a crowd of people is forced to drop their urgent, important, and interesting tasks to gather under one roof. All this, just to listen to three or five people flex their rhetorical muscles, arguing over matters that are discussed without decision, decided without execution, or executed without success. It is truly the ultimate method of collective time-wasting. If it were merely killing time, that might be forgivable. The real tragedy is how it dampens one’s spirits and ruins a perfectly good mood. Though a meeting room is not a battlefield, it possesses a stifling air of solemnity. Upon entering, whether wise or foolish, noble or base, everyone shifts out of their normal character. People don masks and harbor private agendas. Faced with redundant drafts and overly detailed clauses, everyone engages in nitpicking and endless deliberation. They strive for wording that is so rigorous, comprehensive, and watertight that it blocks every possible loophole and opportunity once and for all.

Do some Chinese people have a bizarre obsession with the title of “Infrastructure Maniac”? Anyone who thinks this can replace standard courier services like SF Express should seriously retake high school physics, or at least solve a couple of mechanics problems before asking such a ridiculous question. Just think about it: what kind of functionally low-IQ product manager would come up with this requirement? Raising the cost by tens of thousands of times just to shave off an hour or two? Doesn’t physics deserve some respect? Do you understand G-force? The vibration during launch is so intense that if you shipped a MacBook, the screen would probably shatter into dust. Then you’d have to wrap the package in three layers of aerospace-grade cushioning material. Isn’t that the definition of flogging a dead horse (Chinese: 脱裤子放屁, literally: pulling down pants to fart)? And the landing is another huge issue. A rocket can’t just stop in front of your house like a Meituan delivery driver. The noise is like a cannon going off right next to your ear. It has to land hundreds of miles away from the city, either in the sea or on a remote Gobi desert, and then be transferred back. This is like completely re-architecting the entire backend to optimize a 0.1ms latency, only to find that the bottleneck was entirely on the database I/O. It’s pure self-gratification—a classic example of over-engineering. To be frank, the current niche for this service is for the super-rich elite in life-or-death situations—transporting a heart, a kidney, or sending urgent wartime supplies. The rest of the so-called “space e-commerce” is entirely cheap hype, operating in the same way as the current AI industry. All the “applications” are just chains of if-else statements, pretending to be AGI, simply to fleece money from the primary market. Starship is cool and impressive to look at, but let’s not mythologize it. It’s just a large-scale transport truck. Unless they can bring the failure rate down to the level of commercial aviation, who would dare to use it? Insurance companies would see the policy and immediately run for the hills overnight.

For example: Huawei equals patriotism or an intelligence tax, Xiaomi equals losers, and Apple equals traitors. Once a Tag is slapped on, the brain gets comfortable and stops spinning. These people are like a broken LLM: input a token, and it only spits out those few fixed characters with the highest probability. This is the so-called “approximate news.” Garbage resulting from increased information entropy. The only way to avoid having your brain violated by this garbage is to clean up the input source. Don’t watch those videos where digital influencers shill for money, and don’t listen to people in the comments section earning 3,000 a month teaching you how to spend 8,000. The other day I passed a store and casually touched the Mate 60 or whatever that new thing is called. I am extremely nauseated by Huawei’s “wolf culture” and their practice of using certain sentiments as marketing tools. It looks disgusting—a thick stench of Chinese-style paternalism and collectivist hysteria. However. Setting aside this metaphysical stench and returning to the industrial product itself. Although I am a victim of the nearly full Apple ecosystem, I have to admit that Huawei is indeed in the first tier in the digital realm, leaving other domestic products leagues behind. The system animations, although they still have a whiff of Android about them, are indeed in the first tier regarding responsiveness and frame drop control, uh… At this point, some people will feel a sense of dissonance. They feel dissonance because they still care about dignity, and they still attempt to use logic to unify this world. The reality is: a company can be a clown in marketing while being a giant in engineering. These two are not contradictory at all. Let’s try to deconstruct Huawei into two objects: Object A: Huawei as a commercial/political symbol (you may have controversies about this). Object B: Huawei phones as a communication tool (which you feel is top-tier after experiencing). Conclusion: These two can coexist without contradiction. You can dislike some of its marketing while appreciating its engineering capabilities.\rJust like how I can think Tim Cook is a total moron who sacrifices aesthetics for financial reports (that Dynamic Island is truly a stain on the history of human aesthetics; digging a hole in the screen for FaceID, Jobs’ coffin lid must be rattling), while being unable to leave the Mac trackpad and ecosystem continuity. Offline experience is real; online noise is fake. Most people’s definition of “good and bad” is binary. But in the eyes of the tech elite, products are only about Trade-offs. Huawei uses the process disadvantage of its SoC to trade for extreme optimization of system scheduling, and uses price premiums to trade for a so-called brand moat. Android shits in the root directory, trading chaotic file management for so-called “openness” (although current Android, due to cancerous domestic apps, has long been as laggy as shit). If you don’t want to be led astray, just remember one rule: Trust your contact. When your real tactile feedback tells you “this phone feels great,” that is the absolute truth. It doesn’t matter if ten thousand idiots online say it’s “electronic garbage” or “far ahead.” Of course, I don’t use Huawei.
